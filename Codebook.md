This is simply an addendum to the information in the features_info.txt of the project dataset as there's no need to repeat any of that info.

## Final Output

(taken from README.md)
Finally, the processed dataset of step 5 is output to the console. That is: "the average of each variable for each activity and each subject". Columns specify the groupings (either an activity label or a subject number) and rows represent the measurement variable that the mean was calculated over (that is, the mean() and std() of the measurements). The rows/columns can easily be reversed with t() to suit preference.
